			This website talks all about the presence of LGBTQ+ in our society today. It covers topics such as an introduction to LGBTQ+, a brief overview of sexual orientation in general, how one can raise awareness for people in the LGBTQ+ community, and firsthand experiences from the creators of the website. Overall, it aims to help someone properly understand what LGBTQ+ actually is, what issues are presented to this group of people, and what they can do to promote acceptance of LGBTQ+ in their community.
