I'm a part of the LGBTQ+ Community. My co-creator and I decided to create a website like this because as a gay person that only my friends know, and I want to educate people to be more accepting of LGBTQ+ and that this is not just a trend. It was very hard for me to come out to my friends initially because I was afraid of not being accepted, but here I am. I want to make sure nobody else has to feel what I felt during the time I was struggling.<!DOCTYPE html>

					I'm Mio Dizon, co-creator of Badings! I've been hearing and reflecting about the issues concerning the LGBTQ+ community for years now, and although I am not a member of this community, I want to do my best to let people know more about what LGBTQ+ is and how they can spread awareness about this topic to others, which is my inspiration for creating this website with Tres.
