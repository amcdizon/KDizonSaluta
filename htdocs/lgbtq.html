    <!--introduction to LGBTQ+-->
    <div id="intro_lgbtq">
      <p>The term LGBTQIA+ comes from the acronym Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual, and more. It is a community that includes other people having sexual orientations and gender identities that are different from heteronormativity. It also promotes pride, diversity, individuality, and sexuality. Facing discrimination, Pride Marches have become more common in order to educate people about LGBTQIA+, and on June of every year, Pride Month is celebrated. Pride Month is spent to teach and make sure people have the right image of LGBTQIA+.</p>

    <div id="history">
    <p>Around 1988 was when LGBTQ+ was first founded. This was when the movement of members in the community started to take action in order to gain more respect. However, despite the term LGBTQ+ not including others like pansexuality, or asexuality, it is more of an umbrella term used to tell that you are a part of it.</p>
